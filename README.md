##RecipeBox

RecipeBox is a simple app built with Ruby on Rails. It is a kind of "student project" or "noob's first effort" after some months of self-study of RoR. I wanted to create an app with something that interested, and I like to cook, so  this is it. I also wanted to gain practice working with relational databases and CRUD in the RoR framework.

Cooking enthusiasts can view recipes, search for them by type, such as entree or dessert, or ingredient, such as chicken or potatoes.

Users can upload their own favorite recipes by registering. Minimum user requirements are an email and password. They can fill out additional information on a profile page. Eventually a blog for guest "chefs" will be developed, along with a forum where food fans can post questions on recipes or techniques and provide advice to others.

Gems used in project include:

* bootstrap-sass with customized CSS and google-webfonts for easy Google font setup
* simple_form for efficient form creation
* Carrierwave and rmagick for user uploads of personal avatars and recipe images
* Devise for quick setup of user registation, login and logout
